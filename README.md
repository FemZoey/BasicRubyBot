# BasicRubyBot
### A very basic ruby discord bot that has 3 commands and a base64 message logger!

## How to get started?

First you need to get bundler with:

```
gem install bundler
```

Then you need to get [discord.rb](https://github.com/meew0/discordrb):

```
gem 'discordrb'
```

## Running the .rb file

Open command prompt in the directory you have the bot on and do:

```
ruby bot.rb
```


# Thank you!
